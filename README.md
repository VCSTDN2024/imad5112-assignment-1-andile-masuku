7. Challenges and Learnings
---------------------------

```markdown
## Challenges and Learnings

During the development of this project, I encountered several challenges, including:

1. **Challenge 1**: [Briefly describe a challenge you faced, e.g., "Implementing a complex feature like the login system."]
   - **Solution**: [How you solved the challenge, e.g., "I researched Firebase authentication and successfully integrated it into the app."]
   
2. **Challenge 2**: [Describe another challenge, e.g., "Debugging issues related to Gradle builds."]
   - **Solution**: [How you solved the challenge.]

From these challenges, I learned important lessons in debugging, using version control, and automating build processes with GitHub Actions.
```

Why:
----
- Reflecting on challenges and solutions shows growth and problem-solving skills, which are critical for students. It also gives insight into their learning process, which can be valuable to employers.

8. Future Enhancements
----------------------

```markdown
## Future Enhancements

While the current version of the app provides the core functionality, there are several features that could be added in the future, including:

1. **Feature 1**: [Description, e.g., "Allowing users to set up reminders or notifications."]
2. **Feature 2**: [Description, e.g., "Integrating with a cloud database for storing user data."]
3. **Feature 3**: [Description, e.g., "Adding a dark mode option for better user experience."]

These enhancements would improve the app’s usability and make it even more versatile for end-users.
```

Why:
----
- Suggesting future improvements shows forward thinking and a desire to continuously improve. It also demonstrates that the student has a clear vision for the app beyond the current assignment.

9. References
-------------

```markdown
## References

1. [Reference 1: E.g., any books, articles, or online resources you used during development.]
2. [Reference 2: Any relevant papers, documentation, or tutorials.]
```

Why:
----
- The References section is critical for academic work to acknowledge the resources and inspiration used during the project.

## Disclosure of AI Usage in My Assessment

In the development of this project, I have used generative AI tools to assist in various parts of the assignment. Below is a detailed disclosure of where and how these tools were used:

### 1. **Section(s) in which Generative AI was used:**
- **Question 2.2**: Used AI for brainstorming ideas for the app's features.
- **Part 5**: Assisted in creating code snippets for setting up GitHub Actions workflows.
- **Part 3**: Used AI to help improve the grammar and clarity of the report.

### 2. **Name of AI Tool(s) Used:**
- **ChatGPT** (OpenAI)
- **GitHub Copilot** (GitHub)

### 3. **Purpose/Intention Behind Use:**
- **Brainstorming**: Used ChatGPT to generate ideas for the app’s features and functionality.
- **Meaning Making**: Used AI to clarify some concepts and gain a better understanding of how certain technologies (e.g., GitHub Actions) work.
- **Initial Investigation**: Utilized AI to conduct research on best practices for Android app development and GitHub Actions setup.
- **Code Assistance**: GitHub Copilot was used to assist in writing specific parts of the code, such as setting up GitHub Actions and working with Gradle.
- **Correcting Grammar and Spelling**: ChatGPT helped review and correct the grammar and clarity of my project report.

### 4. **Date(s) in Which Generative AI Was Used:**
- **Question 2.2**: AI used on **March 5, 2025** for brainstorming feature ideas.
- **Part 5**: AI used on **March 8, 2025** to help set up GitHub Actions.
- **Part 3**: AI used on **March 10, 2025** for reviewing the final report.

### 5. **Link to the AI Chat(s) or Screenshots:**
- **Chat 1 (Brainstorming App Features)**: [Link to the AI conversation/chat](insert_link_here)  
  *(Screenshot/Link to Chat: AI provided feature ideas for app development)*

- **Chat 2 (GitHub Actions Workflow Setup)**: [Link to the AI conversation/chat](insert_link_here)  
  *(Screenshot/Link to Chat: AI assisted with configuring GitHub Actions for the project)*

- **Chat 3 (Grammar Review)**: [Link to the AI conversation/chat](insert_link_here)  
  *(Screenshot/Link to Chat: AI helped in reviewing and correcting the report’s grammar)*

```

Why:
----
- This section ensures that students are transparent about using AI tools in their project, promoting academic honesty and adhering to institution guidelines.
