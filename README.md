2. Project Overview

```markdown
## Project Overview

The **[LUNA'S SPECIAL DELUXE MEAL APP]** is a mobile application developed as part of an assignment in the [IMAD5112] subject. This application was created using **Kotlin** and **Android Studio**. The app's primary purpose is to [briefly describe the purpose of the app, e.g., do calculations, generate age, meal suggestions, etc.].

The app was developed to meet the requirements of the assignment, which includes creating a functional mobile app and utilizing GitHub for version control and CI/CD automation using GitHub Actions.
```
THIS
- Provides a brief, high-level summary of the project. This helps anyone reading the document (including your lecturer and potential future employers) understand the app’s purpose quickly.

3. App Purpose and Features
---------------------------

```markdown
## Purpose and Features

### Purpose:
The main goal of this app is to [explain the app’s functionality]. 

### Key Features:
- Feature 1: [Description of a feature, e.g., "User login functionality"]
- Feature 2: [Description of another feature, e.g., "Displaying weather data based on location"]
- Feature 3: [Optional, another feature, e.g., "Push notifications for reminders"]

These features aim to provide [what the app aims to achieve, e.g., an easy-to-use platform for managing tasks or organizing personal information].
```

- This section breaks down the specific features and the purpose of the app, giving clarity on the app’s functionality.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4. Design Considerations
------------------------

```markdown
## Design Considerations

The design of the **[LUNA'S SPECIAL DELUXE MEAL SUGGESTION]** was based on the following key considerations:

1. **User Experience (UX)**: The app was designed with the goal of providing an intuitive and easy-to-navigate user interface, ensuring a seamless user experience.
   
2. **Responsiveness**: The app was built to ensure it performs well on different screen sizes, with particular attention to device compatibility.
   
3. **Simplicity**: The design is minimalistic, focusing on core features without overwhelming the user.
   
4. **Performance**: Code optimization was considered to ensure fast response times and low battery usage.
```

This
----
- Highlights the thought process behind the design choices. It demonstrates that students are considering not just the functionality, but also the usability and performance aspects of the app, which is a professional approach.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

5. GitHub and GitHub Actions Utilization
----------------------------------------
```markdown
## GitHub and GitHub Actions

This project was managed using **GitHub** for version control, where all code changes were committed and pushed regularly. GitHub enabled collaborative coding, allowing me to keep track of changes and maintain project integrity.

### GitHub Actions:
I utilized **GitHub Actions** to automate the build and deployment process. This includes:

- Running automated **tests** to ensure the app’s functionality.
- Compiling the app into **APK** and **AAB** files, which are the formats required for distribution.
- Uploading these build artifacts to GitHub for easy access.

The workflow ensures that my project is automatically built and tested every time I push changes, and it simplifies the process of delivering the final APK/AAB files for submission.
```

- This section educates students on why they should understand version control (GitHub) and automation (GitHub Actions). It shows how they’re adopting industry-standard practices, which is useful for both academic purposes and career development.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

7. Challenges and Learnings
---------------------------

```markdown
## Challenges and Learnings

During the development of this project, I encountered several challenges, including:

1. **Challenge 1**: ["I was not able to run my app on the virtual device and on my Android Studio"]
   - **Solution**: ["I researched the error on google... and I successfully ended up finding out that the problem was on one of my xml.files and fixed the error."]
   
2. **Challenge 2**: ["I had a hard time getting my generating button to work."]
   - **Solution**: ["I had to change my code and use it in a different way."]

From these challenges, I learned important lessons in debugging, using version control, making sure you use the correct code, to make sure that everything is closed up or declared, and automating build processes with GitHub Actions.
```
THIS IS FOR
----
- Reflecting on challenges and solutions shows growth and problem-solving skills, which are critical for students. It also gives insight into their learning process, which can be valuable to employers.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

8. Future Enhancements
----------------------

```markdown
## Future Enhancements

While the current version of the app provides the core functionality, there are several features that could be added in the future, including:

1. **Feature 1**: [Notifications, "Allowing users to set up reminders or notifications."]
2. **Feature 2**: [StorageDrive, "Integrating with a cloud database for storing user data."]
3. **Feature 3**: [Theme, "Adding different mode option for better user experience."]
4. **Feature 4**: [Font, " Adding different font and size for much greater experience"]
5. **Feature 5**: [Pictures, " To know what type of food it is and how it looks like."]

These enhancements would improve the app’s usability and make it even more versatile for end-users.
```
FOR
----
- Suggesting future improvements shows forward thinking and a desire to continuously improve. It also demonstrates that the student has a clear vision for the app beyond the current assignment.
